# HYPE Processing Library

A project maintained by [Joshua Davis](https://github.com/hype/) / [twitter.com/joshuadavis](https://twitter.com/joshuadavis/).

A collection of classes that performs the heavy lifting for you by writing a minimal amount of code.

This library is currently under heavy development. You can keep track of the latest changes here in the [CHANGELOG][1].

## Getting Started ##

### Install to Processing Sketchbook

The HYPE library may be uzipped from the `distribution` folder and manually placed within the `libraries` folder of your Processing sketchbook. To find (and change) the Processing sketchbook location on your computer, open the Preferences window from the Processing application (PDE) and look for the "Sketchbook location" item at the top.

By default the following locations are used for your sketchbook folder:
  * For Mac users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `~/Documents/Processing`
  * For Windows users, the sketchbook folder is located inside `My Documents/Processing`

Download HYPE from https://github.com/hype/HYPE_Processing

Unzip and copy the HYPE folder into the `libraries` folder in the Processing sketchbook. You will need to create this `libraries` folder if it does not exist.

The folder structure for HYPE should be as follows:

```
Processing
  libraries
    HYPE
      examples
      library
        HYPE.jar
      reference
      src
```

After HYPE has been successfully installed, restart the Processing application.

#### Build Sources with ANT
Copy example-build.properties to build.properties
You'll need to update 'sketchbook.location' and 'classpath.local.location' in build.properties to match your local environment.
Run build.xml in the Resources folder.

The HYPE library will be added to your sketchbook folder automatically as part of the build process.
